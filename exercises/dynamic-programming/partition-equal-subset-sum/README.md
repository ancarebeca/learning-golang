Given a non-empty array of positive integers arr[]. Write a program to find if the array can be partitioned into two 
subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Example 1

    Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 11, 6]
    Output: true  
    Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [6, 6] and [1, 11].

Example 2

    Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 7]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets
