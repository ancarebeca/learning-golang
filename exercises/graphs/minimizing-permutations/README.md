Minimizing Permutations

    In this problem, you are given an integer N, and a permutation, P of the integers from 1 to N, denoted as (a_1, a_2, ..., a_N).
    You want to rearrange the elements of the permutation into increasing order, repeatedly making the following operation:
    Select a sub-portion of the permutation, (a_i, ..., a_j), and reverse its order.
    Your goal is to compute the minimum number of such operations required to return the permutation to increasing order.

    Signature
    int minOperations(int[] arr)

    Input
    Array arr is a permutation of all integers from 1 to N, N is between 1 and 8

    Output
    An integer denoting the minimum number of operations required to arrange the permutation in increasing order

    Example
    If N = 3, and P = (3, 1, 2), we can do the following operations:
    Select (1, 2) and reverse it: P = (3, 2, 1).
    Select (3, 2, 1) and reverse it: P = (1, 2, 3).
    output = 2
