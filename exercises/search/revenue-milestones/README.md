Revenue Milestones

    We keep track of the revenue Facebook makes every day, and we want to know on what days Facebook hits certain revenue 
    milestones. Given an array of the revenue on each day, and an array of milestones Facebook wants to reach, return an 
    array containing the days on which Facebook reached every milestone.

    Signature
        int[] getMilestoneDays(int[] revenues, int[] milestones)
    
    Input
        revenues is a length-N array representing how much revenue FB made on each day (from day 1 to day N). milestones 
        is a length-K array of total revenue milestones.
    
    Output
        Return a length-K array where K_i is the day on which FB first had milestones[i] total revenue. If the milestone 
        is never met, return -1.
    
    Example
        revenues = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
        milestones = [100, 200, 500]
        output = [4, 6, 10]

    Explanation
        On days 4, 5, and 6, FB has total revenue of $100, $150, and $210 respectively. Day 6 is the first time that FB
        has >= $200 of total revenue.
