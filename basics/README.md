### Packages, Variable, Values & Types
Exercises: 
    1. Using the short declaration operator, ASSIGN these VALUES to VARIABLES with the IDENTIFIERS “x” and “y” and “z”
          a) 42
          b) "James Bond"
          c) true
          
          Now print the values stored in those variables using 
          a) a single print statement
          b) multiple print statements

### Flow control statements
Exercises: 
  1. Write a program that check checks whether a number is even

  2. Write a program in Go to add the first 5 natural numbers and display the following      
      ```
         The total before loop is 0
         Begining of the loop
         0 + 0 = 0
         0 + 1 = 1
         1 + 2 = 3
         3 + 3 = 6
         6 + 4 = 10
         10 + 5 = 15
         15 + 6 = 21
         21 + 7 = 28
         28 + 8 = 36
         36 + 9 = 45
         End of the loop
         The total before loop is 45
     ```

### Function
1. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10
    here’s the solution:  https://play.golang.org/p/TfYuAT3D22O
2. Write a function called FooBar that takes input integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 upto n in a new line. 
   If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Foo", if the number is divisible by 5 then print "Bar" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FooBar". Otherwise just print the number.
   for example FooBar(15) should print as follows:
   1
   2
   Foo
   4
   Bar
   Foo
   7
   8
   Foo
   Bar
   11
   Foo
   13
   14
   FooBar
   
3. Write a function that returns true if a word is a palindrome and false in other case. Use this [link](https://play.golang.org/p/B0VN5VcTU4l) as a template
