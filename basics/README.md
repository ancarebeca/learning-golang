### Packages, Variable, Values & Types
Exercises: 
    1. Using the short declaration operator, ASSIGN these VALUES to VARIABLES with the IDENTIFIERS “x” and “y” and “z”
          a) 42
          b) "James Bond"
          c) true
          
          Now print the values stored in those variables using 
          a) a single print statement
          b) multiple print statements
          Here’s the solution: https://play.golang.org/p/yYXnWXIQNa 

    2. Write a program that reads in the length and width of a rectangle in cm and computes its area.

### Flow control statements
Exercises: 
  1. Write a program that check checks whether a number is even
      here’s the solution: https://play.golang.org/p/nTEiUqdU90f
  2. Write a program in Go to display the first 10 natural numbers.
    
### Function
1. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10
    here’s the solution:  https://play.golang.org/p/TfYuAT3D22O
2. Write a function called FooBar that takes input integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 upto n in a new line. 
   If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Foo", if the number is divisible by 5 then print "Bar" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FooBar". Otherwise just print the number.
   for example FooBar(15) should print as follows:
   1
   2
   Foo
   4
   Bar
   Foo
   7
   8
   Foo
   Bar
   11
   Foo
   13
   14
   FooBar
   
3. Write a function that returns true if a word is a palindrome and false in other case. Use this [link](https://play.golang.org/p/B0VN5VcTU4l) as a template
